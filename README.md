## Background

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) publishes data collected from financial institutions to ensure consumers are protected. The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) allows the collected of mortgages.
Some data is publicly available on www.ffiec.cfpb.gov. 

The data for NJ is downloaded from the website and visualizations are created in Tableau and Power BI. 


## Data wrangling

CSV Files of HMDA Data are uploaded to the following link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/191PtdJbMihy_v8rT-C4WkGhB8KPQ8Bw9?usp=sharing

The data wrangling to filter unnecessary data is done using the Jupyter notebooks. Some records that have null values are not filtered to preserve data of certain categories such as county, applicant_age, purchaser_type, etc.
